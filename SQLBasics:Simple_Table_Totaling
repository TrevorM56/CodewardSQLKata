# For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.

# people table schema
#  name
#  points
#  clan
# You should then return a table that resembles below

# select on
#  rank
#  clan
#  total_points
#  total_people
# The query must rank each clan by their total_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) 
# you must replace it with [no clan specified], you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.

# ##Note The data is loaded from the live leaderboard, this means values will change but also could cause the kata to time out retreiving the information.





SELECT
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC) AS rank,
  COALESCE(NULLIF(clan, ''), '[no clan specified]') AS clan,
  SUM(points) AS total_points,
  COUNT(name) AS total_people
FROM
  people
GROUP BY 
  clan;

# The RANK() method allows us to create a ranking column, where the OVER() method allows us to choose how we are going to rank the column.

# In the second line, we use the COALESCE method to substitute our empty clan names for '[no clan specified]', this occurs because the NULLIF() method will return NULL 
# when the clan and '' are equal, thus returning a null value, allowing the COALESCE method to return the second value as ['no clan specified']
# We use the SUM() method on the points column to get total points
# Lastly, we use the COUNT() function on name to find the total_people in each clan. (only works because we GROUP BY clan later in the query)
